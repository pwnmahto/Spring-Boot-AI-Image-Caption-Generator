# Spring-Boot-AI-Image-Caption-Generator

Develop a REST API using Spring Boot and Spring AI to generate image captions.

### 2. **AI Image Caption Generator**

#### Project Overview:

Create a service where users can upload an image, and the AI generates a caption describing what is in the image. You
can integrate with models like OpenAI’s DALL·E or Hugging Face Vision Transformers to handle image processing and
caption generation.

**Steps:**

- **Step 1**: Build a Spring Boot application with image upload functionality.
- **Step 2**: Integrate an AI model that supports image captioning.
- **Step 3**: Create a REST API endpoint where users can POST an image file.
- **Step 4**: The AI generates a caption based on the image and sends it back as a response.

**Example Use Case**:
This could be useful for improving accessibility on the web by automatically generating alt text for images or for
social media platforms to generate captions for photos.
